- name: ATM-Challenge
  description: During the first week of course I went through the ATM challenge. The scope of the challenge was to build a Ruby prototype of an ATM with basic functionality that could be run in IRB. This challenge introduced me to the standard naming convention and RSpec (which is the most frequently used testing library for Ruby applications) as my first testing framework to run some unit tests on each class. In order to complete the challenge I had to go through different basic concepts like what an expectation is when running a test, what it means to initialize a class and assign attributes to it (and starting to see the difference between an attr_accessor, _reader and _writer), defining methods and thinking about what arguments they should take, using control flow statements. The ATM challenge also intriduced me to Git as an extremely important version control tool, walking me through initializing repositories, adding them on GitHub and the first basic git commands.
